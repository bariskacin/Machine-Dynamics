# Machine Dynamic
To perform Static or Dynamic analysis on a mechanism, it is necessary to know the dimensions and angles of all links on the mechanism. 
At any given moment, the desired position information (dimensions and angles) of a mechanism can be determined through simple geometric/trigonometric calculations or using software packages like Solidworks by drawing. 
However, this is only a temporary solution for that moment. The essential task is to find the desired values for all movements of the mechanism. 
Therefore, a more valid method is to derive analytical formulas that calculate the positions of the movement.
